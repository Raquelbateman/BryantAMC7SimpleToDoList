<b>Bugs That Were Dealt With:</b>
1. The edit button drove me insane. I could not get it to work for the life of me. I didnt realize I had to add a useState for both editing and inputing the tasks at hand but after i did that it was sorta a "duh" moment and i was able to continue with my code.
2. I could not get the dot away from my list item. It took me longer than it should have only to realize that I needed to style my "ul" in the css file. Once I did that, the dot went away.
